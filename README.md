## Description

######  Using the most recent complete baseball statistics dataset from Sean Lahman's website, this notebook provides the names and positions of the nine best players based on their on-base percentage(OBP) and salary.  The nine names presented are determined by looking for players with the best OBP,  lowest salary, and most number of games played in a certain position.  This project included completing the following with pandas:

* Reading .csv files using only certain columns
* Merging multiple DataFrames
* Adding columns to existing DataFrames
* Preforming calculations to determine necessary values
* Filtering DataFrames
* Sorting DataFrames
* Concatenating multiple DataFrames
